For this project I was tasked with creating a searchable, sortable table of satellites. For the purposes of the assignment, a satellite was defined as any object purposefully placed into orbit.

## Features:

1) Satellites: Each row in the table contains data on one satellite.
2) Search form: Filters the results based on matches to the entered text. Pressing enter or clicking the button triggers the search.
3) Sortable columns: The Name and Type column headers can be clicked, which will sort the table by corresponding property.
4) Counts: Displays the total number of satellites in the table, as well as the count for each type of satellite. This also updates on search.

## I learned how to:

1) Iterate over JSON files to create objects
2) Utilize Angular CLI, TypeScript and component generation
3) Incorporate templates to make dynamic pages
4) Use data-binding
5) Employ Firebase to deploy Angular apps
